Summary: The story of BaaS

## What is Boss as a Service?

Boss as a Service is a hybrid productivity tool which actually gives you a living, breathing boss. In short, Boss as a Service oversees and monitors your progress towards your goals, much as a real life boss would, by focussing on whether or not you're completing your tasks by deadline. If you're not, Boss as a Service will follow up and not leave off till it's resolved.
