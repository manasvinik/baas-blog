summary: Introduction and quick post on what this blog, and Boss as a Service, is all about.

I’ve always struggled with procrastination, or if I want to be fancy about it, akrasia. 

> Akrasia (/əˈkreɪziə/; Greek ἀκρασία, "lacking command"), occasionally transliterated as acrasia or Anglicised as acrasy or acracy, is described as a lack of self-control or the state of acting against one's better judgment.

And combined with this, I’m also fairly ambitious. I want to do more things, I want to learn more things. 

This is what I wrote in a blog circa 2016. 

> I am a bit of a productivity nerd. If there's a productivity app out there, chances are I've tried it. For a while, I secretly nourished the belief that the perfect to-do app for me existed. Somewhere out there. And when we meet each other, sparks will fly, it will be a match made in heaven, and someone might make a movie about it. In the end, I decided to just make it myself. While the vision might change a bit, right now it's looking like a more powerful version of Carrot -- an AI that organizes your tasks and ensures you're productive. If you'd like to be notified when this is usable, please let me know here.

I did try to build this. But many false starts later, I realized something I ought to have understood years back. My love of cool UIs and spiffy interactions was leading me astray. 

It literally doesn’t matter how clean and streamlined and good looking and AI infused (lol, right) your app is. At the end of the day, it’s no different than thousands of other apps out there whose primary purpose is to let you keep a record of your todos. Now they may organize them, reorganize them, read them out to you and give you voice reminders, or roll them in  honey and molten candy. It doesn’t matter. At the core of it, the value it offers is “You can store your todos here.” I’m not knocking that – a lot of these apps are wonderfully designed and a delight to use, but my experience with them tends to be this: I sign up, full of excitement, and add my todos to them. I forget them. One month later, I find another one. Rinse and repeat.

I (or for that matter, you) don’t need another app to write down your todos in. Get out of here. Use whatever you want. Use Todoist, use Wunderlist, use a pen and paper. 

What you need is something that ensures you get your work done.

It took me over two years to understand that my own productive peak was when I worked for someone else. Many factors contributed to this – a feeling of accountability, the fact that I was getting paid to work, and that I had very little wiggle room in terms of deadlines. I got things done, almost on autopilot, because there was no other choice; if I didn’t, there would be someone to demand answers. 

I wanted to recreate that pressure and feeling of accountability for (a) people who don’t have it already (freelancers, founders, students, writers, anyone who works on their own) (b) for areas in life where you don’t have a boss checking on you (self-improvement, learning, fitness, personal goals in general).

Yay, (Boss as a Service)[https://bossasaservice.life] was born. We launched on January 9, 2018. Our first customer (who’s still with us, 3+ months down the line) signed up exactly one hour after the launch. A more detailed blog on the launch is on the way, but this post was intended to just be an introduction to what this blog is about.

## What we’ll talk about in this blog

First, I promise I won’t talk about BaaS all the time on this blog! We have plans for lots of posts on productivity, getting things done, and fighting procrastination. That’s one part of it.

The second part is inside workings of BaaS. I’ll try my best to be open and transparent about how we’re doing things, and how things are 

And we really want to publish only in depth, well researched and well written articles, and most of them have a unique perspective. Because what’s the point of adding more nonsense to the ocean of nonsense on the internet?
